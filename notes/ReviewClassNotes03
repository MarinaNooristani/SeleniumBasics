Alerts:
1. Web Based Alerts -->html -->can be dealt using selenium
2. javaScript Alerts -->
3. Windows Based alert-->example (choose a file) and the window that pops up is a windows based alert

we are not typing anything on the UI. we're directly sending the text to the javascript code(bts or backend) and the
option for displaying it on the screen is disabled that's why we don't see the text in the prompt alert


Frames:
u need to switch to the frame in order to deal with the desired element

for switching you use driver.switchTo().frame();
3 methods.
1. by the index number of the frame
2. by the name or id
3. by accessing the frame as a webElement



<html>
	<body>


	</body>


<html>


click on the check box that resides inside another frame....

with Thread.sleep() you can't predict the wait time
implicit wait minimum 12 secs and maximum 20 secs

Explicit wait

 WebDriverWait wait=new WebDriverWait(driver,20);

 why the timeout is important?




        wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated


        use implicit wait when the element is not even in the dom/ needs to appear

        and use explicit wait if the element has certain conditon associated with it like
        visibility, clickability, e.t.c
